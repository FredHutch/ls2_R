# ls2_R
Our build of R, including many packages our users have requested over the years
.

This is an EasyBuild-based build, and pulls the R easyconfig from our easybuild-life-sciences repo on GitHub.

R package requests should be made in issues on that repo, rather than this one. Issue on this repo should be related to the Dockerfile only.
